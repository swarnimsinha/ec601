Creating a branch - develop to test things and then merge later with master

Installing
1) Open terminal and paste the following command :
<sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv>
2) The samples that we have created are in the /opencv/samples/python directory
3) To run them type in : 
<python canny.py>
4) This opens a window where canny edge filter is applied. Change the trackbars to view how changing the threshold affects the image
